        Remove Nth Node from end of a linked list
        ------------------------------------
         Purpose : to remove the Nth node from end of the linked list
         Approach: We use a two pointer approach. The first and second pointer both start by refering to head.
         We then move the second pointer by N steps without moving the first pointer. 
         Now both the pointers have a distance of N nodes between them.
         Now, we move both the pointer by a step each until the second pointer reaches the end of linked list.
         Since both the pointers will still be at a distacne of N nodes , when the second pointer reaches the end of linked list , 
         the first pointer will be at a distance of N nodes from the end i.e at the Nth node from the end.
         So we delete the node pointed by the first pointer.

         Edge Case: There are 2 possible edge cases in the above mentioned approach
         ---------------------------------------------------
         While moving the second pointer by N nodes , we keep checking if the "next" of the second pointer is null
         If it is null then 2 cases may arise:
         1) The length of linked list is exactly N and in that case the value of the loop variable i would be N-1 
         and the Nth node from end would be the head. So in that case we update the head by setting the head to head.next
         2) The length of list is < n :
         In this case, since we can't delete the Nth node from the end, we simply return head .
         


         Time Complexity:
         --------------------
         O(L): where L is the length of the Linked List
