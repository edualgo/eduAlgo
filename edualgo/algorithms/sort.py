    Cycle Sort
    ------------------------------------
    Cycle sort is an in-place unstable sorting algorithm, a comparison sort 
    that is theoretically optimal in terms of the total number of writes to 
    the original array.

    Purpose : sorting in increasing order

    Method : It is based on the idea that array to be sorted can 
             be divided into cycles. Cycles can be visualized as a graph. 
  
    Time Complexity : Best Case - O(n^2)
                      Average Case - O(n^2)
                      Worst Case - O(n^2)

    Hint :
        - Consider an array of 'n' distinct elements.
        - An element 'a' is given, index of 'a' can be calculated 
          by counting the number of elements that are smaller than 'a'. 
        - If the element is found to be at its correct position, simply leave it as it is.
        - Otherwise, find the correct position of a by counting the total number of elements 
          that are less than 'a', where it must be present in the sorted array. 
        - The other element b which is replaced is to be moved to its correct position. 
        - This process continues till we get an element at the original position of 'a'.
  
    Pseudocode :
        Begin
        for start := 0 to n – 2 do
            key := array[start]
            location := start
            for i := start + 1 to n - 1 do
                if array[i] < key then
                    location := location + 1
            done

            if location = start then
                ignore lower part, go for next iteration
            while key = array[location] do
                location := location + 1
            done

            if location ≠ start then
                swap array[location] with key
            while location ≠ start do
                location := start
                for i := start + 1 to n - 1 do
                    if array[i] < key then
                        location := location + 1
                done

                while key = array[location]
                    location := location + 1
                if key ≠ array[location]
                    swap array[location] and key
            done
        done
    End
