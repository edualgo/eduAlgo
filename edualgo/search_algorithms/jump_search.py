    Jump Search
    ------------------------------------
    Purpose: Searching a required number
    Method: Iterating, Comparing
    Time Complexity: The optimal size of a block to be jumped is (√n).
                     This makes the time complexity of Jump Search O(√n).
    Hint:
        Starting from 0th element of arr[], we comparing fewer elements (than linear search) by jumping ahead by fixed steps.
    Pseudocode:
        loc = -1
        step = math.floor(math.sqrt(n))
        for i in range[0,length of array,step to jump]:
            if(arr[i]==search)
                loc = i
                break
            else if(arr[i]<search)
                continue
            else if(arr[i]>search)
                j = i
                j -= (step-1)
                for k in range[j+1, i]
                    if(arr[k]==search)
                        loc = k
                        break
        if(loc<0):
            return "Not found!"
        else:
            return loc
