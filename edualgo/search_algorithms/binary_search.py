    Binary Search
    ------------------------------------
    Purpose : searching a required number in a sorted uniformly distributed array
    SORTED ARRAY- Arranged in ascending order
    Method : Searching first in the position(index) that has maximum probability of having required element.
    Time Complexity: Best case- Î©(1)
                     Worst case- O(logn)
    Hint :
    Starting from 0th element of array[] and comparing every element to x search one by one.
Formula used :                         high+low
       Middle position(pos) =   int (------------)
                                          2
                                where low is the lowest index 
                                      high is the highest index 
                                      x is the number to be searched 
                                      arr[i] is the ith element in the given sorted array 
    Pseudocode:
        while low<=high and array[low]<=array[high]
            if array[low]==x
                return low
            *calculate middle position(pos) with formula above
            if array[pos]< x
                low = pos+1
            else
                high = pos-1 
    Visualization:
    Number to search => x=3
    Given Array : arr[]
index-   0     1     2     3
      +-----+-----+-----+-----+
      |  1  |  3  |  4  |  6  |
      +-----+-----+-----+-----+
    First Iteration :
    +-----+-----+-----+-----+    low = 0            high = 3
    |  1  |  2  |  3  |  6  |    arr[low] = 1       arr[high] = 6
    +-----+-----+-----+-----+
    pos = int(0+3/2) = 1
  =>It will check at arr[pos]==x or not which is not and arr[pos]<x 
  => low = pos+1 = 2
    Second Iteration :
    +-----+-----+-----+-----+    low = 2            high = 3
    |  1  |  3  |  4  |  6  |    arr[low] = 3       arr[high] = 6
    +-----+-----+-----+-----+
    pos = int(2+3/2) = 2 
  =>It will check at arr[pos]==x which is true 
  => It will return 2
    If no element in the array matched x=3 then it would return -1
